# Imad-Lahoud : "Expatriate to the United Arab Emirates

Imad Lahoud has been an expatriate for almost 10 years in Abu Dhabi where he is the technical director of the UAE group Medad. He reveals to us all the attractions of his host country.

The geographical location of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the political stability and the favourable business climate make this Middle Eastern federal state a privileged place for investors from all over the world.

Although the domestic market is limited (10 million inhabitants), the UAE is the best logistical, financial and commercial platform to open up to regional markets.

A strong and reassuring economy

Based on oil and gas resources (30% of the UAE's GDP), the economy has diversified widely: the oil sector (petrochemicals), aluminum production, manufactured goods, finance, and real estate. This diversification, a political choice assumed by the authorities, is accompanied by a series of measures designed to attract investors. Tax rates are among the lowest in the world. In addition, the US currency, the dirham, is linked to the US dollar, thus providing an additional guarantee of stability.

IMAD LAHOUD: MORE THAN 40 FREE TRADE ZONES FOR BUSINESS INITIATIVES

The UAE's free trade zones provide companies that set up shop with significant tax privileges: exemption from corporate tax, income tax and, above all, the possibility of recovering and repatriating the capital invested, as well as any profits or income from liquidation.

The regulation of these territorial enclaves is simplified in the spirit of a very flexible commercial legislation: easy to obtain licenses, easy to import and export.

In addition, the entrepreneur finds a considerable number of additional advantages such as, for example, the low cost of electricity and gas, a very efficient internet connection and a cheap foreign workforce.

There is no tax burden for dividends distributed to shareholders (legal or natural persons). These various advantages must be studied on a case-by-case basis, as standards may vary from one zone to another, with Abu Dhabi and Dubai being the most attractive.

Outside the free zones, a joint partnership with a local company is necessary.

Legal and administrative framework being simplified

The common law legal framework benefits companies used to operating in this environment. English remains the most widely used business language in the UAE. The Federal Union defines the global framework for commercial law, which is then adapted by each Emirate. The weight of Islamic Sharia law, which governs family law, is weak in commercial matters.

New technologies on the rise

Dubai is becoming one of the most "intelligent" and connected cities in the world. One of the sectors that is on the rise is new technologies, especially data storage and transmission as well as topics related to artificial intelligence. Dubai is becoming the capital of blockchains with more than 20 use cases in 8 industrial sectors, in partnership with IBM. The growing number of companies in various sectors, such as hotels, commerce, logistics and banking, requires ever more efficient IT solutions. Dubai is now home to more than 1,200 technology startups: (marketing, online security...). Online commerce is only waiting to develop.

Health is a priority for the UAE

With more than 40 hospitals and state-of-the-art teams, health is a priority for the federal government. The health sector has grown considerably with the implementation of major hospital projects aimed at making the UAE a global reference in the field. This has led to a sharp increase in activities related to the construction and management of hospitals, medical equipment as well as pharmaceutical products.

Imad Lahoud: "One of the sure values: construction"

Every year, new neighborhoods bloom in the Emirates. Foreign companies working in architecture, public works, machinery and construction materials are expanding despite the slowdown in real estate in recent years.

Food: A constant need for supply

Special mention must be made of the agri-food sector. The UAE is an unsuitable desert for agriculture. Foreign companies exporting fruit, vegetables and meat have great business opportunities.

Cities connected to the world

The same is true for transport and service specialists, as Dubai, the largest port in the region, is a hub in the regional economy (Middle East, North Africa, gateway to Asia). Nearly 7000 flights per week to 260 destinations transit through Dubai, with 125 airlines operating in the Emirates. Customs duties are on average 5% on all goods (except tobacco and alcohol, which are heavily taxed).

Investing in real estate

20% of real estate investors in the UAE are foreigners. The main advantages are again the low taxation, but also the reliability of the infrastructure. Dubai in particular is one of the ten fastest growing luxury real estate markets in the world. It is therefore, even now, a good investment option. More than 150 nationalities are represented (Indian, Pakistani, Chinese, English), a significant part of which is made up of business clients looking for a good home. The real estate investor can expect rental yields of between 5 and 9% for a purchase price per square meter lower than in many "global" cities.

The COVID-19 crisis caused a sharp decline in the market. Since June 2020, the outlook is positive due to continued strong demand and a weak dollar.

Niche markets for modest budgets

France has more than 600 subsidiaries with nearly 30,000 employees. These figures suggest that business consulting is also a growing business. There is also a strong demand for financial services: free-lance, accounting, auditing. There is also a niche in education (languages, digital) given the expatriate population, which in Dubai represents more than 80% of the population.

Customs to know to do business

Questions of dress (more conservative than in Europe), social relations, respect for religious times (prayer, Ramadan), restrictions on alcohol, and the sense of hospitality must be mastered quickly to optimize business relations.
